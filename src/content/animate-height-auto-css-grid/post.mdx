# Animating Height: Auto with CSS Grid

I'm writing these words with full knowledge that they will, within the foreseeable future, mostly be rendered obsolete.

Browsers have [thrown support behind a spec](https://m.youtube.com/shorts/NY0t9a7aP6A) for animating to and from `height: auto`. In some cases, browsers have already [implemented this new feature behind a flag](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/FjyMSSaSPEg/m/yzlLscFKBQAJ?pli=1). We will, finally, be able to do the thing that everyone assumes is possible when they first learn about CSS animations. And when that day arrives, and I can dump this post in this trash, I’ll be the first to celebrate.

That this future is foreseeable, though, does not mean that it is imminent. So in the meantime, we have CSS Grid track animations.

## Why is This Useful?

A couple of days ago, I got nerd sniped by Sam Selikoff. He posted to Twitter a detailed breakdown of a fancy, animated todo list demo he’s been building.

His approach uses Framer Motion—along with some fairly complex choreography—to animate the todo items’ heights. I love Framer Motion, but I also believe in the rule of least power. I had recently helped a coworker implement an animated accordion using CSS grid, and I wanted to see if I could recreate Sam’s technique without relying on javascript to coordinate the animation.

Here’s my solution:

[VIDEO OF TODO LIST]

Most often, people seem to use height-based animations to build nicer accordions. But as this demo shows, they’re useful for so much more than that!

Unfortunately, almost all of the [blog](https://www.stefanjudis.com/snippets/how-to-animate-height-with-css-grid/) [posts](https://css-tricks.com/css-grid-can-do-auto-height-transitions/) I’ve seen on this topic offer bad information about how to implement this technique. I want to correct the record so that you can more effectively wield this type of animation in your next project—even if it is just another accordion.

## My Div Overflows

To understand this technique, you need to first understand that CSS grid introduced a new unit of measurement to the language: the `fr` or "fractional" unit.

the `fr` unit is conceptually similar to the `percentage` unit—they both define the size of something relative to its container—but `fr` is specific to CSS grid. If you want a grid with three equally-sized columns, you could say `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr`. Or, to define a grid where one column takes up 2/3 of the grid and the other takes up 1/3 of the grid, you could say `grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr`.

[FR UNIT DEMO]

As you may have noticed in the above demo, you can also declare that a grid column (or row) should be `0fr`. This is effectively the same as setting that element’s width (or height) to zero.

## Trashcan

Implementation takes time. Getting users to update their browsers takes time. And even though this feature—along with other recently-added features like view transitions and scroll-driven animations—is a perfect candidate for progressive enhancement, I’m guessing it will be a while before it’s ready for production.

Way back when I first learned about CSS transitions, I remember almost immediately trying to animate an element to `height: auto`. It’s a technique that I think almost everyone implicitly agrees should work.

It emphatically does not. For a long time, we had some [very hacky](https://css-tricks.com/using-css-transitions-auto-dimensions/) ways to compensate for this inability. Now, with CSS grid, we have a solution that is—and I mean this sincerely—meaningfully less hacky.

To be sure, this isn’t the first article to be written about this topic. But, I felt compelled to write it because, as I was attempting to implement this type of animation recently on a project, I ran into [some explanations](https://www.stefanjudis.com/snippets/how-to-animate-height-with-css-grid/) that were...suboptimal.

To explain the concept, let’s look at the example of a simple accordion element. What we want is to have a section of that accordion that can be animated from `height: 0` to `height: auto`. To accomplish that, we need a CSS grid element with a single child that can be manipulated when the accordion’s open state is toggeled.
