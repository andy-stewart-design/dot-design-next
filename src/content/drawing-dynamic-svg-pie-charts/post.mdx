# Drawing Dynamic SVGs

Not all SVGs are created equal.

Or, to be more precise, not all SVG renderers are created equal. Like most web technologies, [SVG is a specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/)—a standardized set of principles, written out and agreed upon, and then interpretted and executed by a variety of parties over time. This process relies heavily on good faith. No one is checking homework, and any individual implementation may or may not be feature-complete and standard-compliant.

In a time with [such a large emphasis on parity](https://web.dev/blog/interop-2024), it’s a truth that can be easily taken for granted. That is, until it isn’t.

## The Problem

I built my first [Figma widget](https://www.figma.com/widget-docs/) recently. If you don’t know, widgets are basically Figma components with super powers. They live on your design or FigJam canvas like any other component, but they are hydrated with Javascript and are therefore interactive. For our purposes, we built a simple checklist widget to help product designers prepare their files for development and increase transparency in design handoffs.

Given that widgets have to live amongst all your other, common components, Figma provides an understandably constrained set of tools to build them. In our widget, we wanted to include some sort of visual indicator of a user’s progress through the checklist. Given the inherent limitations of the medium, the only path forward seemed to be a custom, dynamic SVG.

My options were even more limited than I realized, though. I first attempted to draw a donut chart using the `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties, as [outlined in a great article](https://heyoka.medium.com/scratch-made-svg-donut-pie-charts-in-html5-2c587e935d72) by Mark Caron.

/>

To my surpise, Figma’s implementation of SVG is non-standard. The `stroke-dasharray` property does not render the same in Figma as it does in browsers, so what appeared to be a straightforward solution turned out to be a nonstarter.

In the end, I found a solution that—while technically more complex—is considerably more flexible than using strokes alone. It also happens to be a good case study for some of the core concepts of working with SVG in code. In this article, I’ll break down the techniques you need to know to execute the following demo in your own project, starting with a brief overview of SVG layouts and then diving into:

1. Programatically drawing paths based on a dynamic set of inputs
2. Using sine and cosine functions to draw arcs and circles
3. Using clipping masks to define our chart’s silhouette

Here’s a preview of what we’ll be building:

<ProgressIndicator />

## Getting On the Grid

An SVG is a world unto itself. Especially when it comes to layout, it cares little about what’s happening outside of its own four corners. The contents of an SVG is arranged along a two dimensional grid with its origin in the top left corner (much like a [2D HTML canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D)). The bounds of that grid are defined by an SVG’s `viewBox`—a string of 4 space-separated numbers corresponding to the `x` and `y` coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the SVG, respectively.

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 32 24"></svg>
```

The code above renders an SVG spanning 32 steps along its x-axis and 24 steps along its y-axis. For all practical purposes, the viewBox’s first two numbers will always be 0, and the last two are often (but not necessarily) the same as the SVG’s width and height. Importantly, though, no matter how large or small the SVG is displayed on screen, the viewBox—and coordinates of the grid that it defines—never changes.

This fact—that the viewBox is defined by fixed steps while it’s rendered width is fluid—is one of the most essential concepts of working with SVG. In practice, it means that everything defined inside the SVG will scale linearly with its width. For example, if you add a circle with a `stroke-width` of 2 to the above SVG and then render it at 96px wide (3x the `viewBox`), that stroke will look roughly equivalent to a 6px line outside of the SVG. This is also true of animations and transitions—the style and position of elements within an SVG are always relative to it’s viewBox, not it’s rendered width.

To see this dynamic in action, take a moment to play around with the sandbox below. Move the circle around, resize the SVG, and generally start to get a feel for how space and layout works inside of an SVG.

<SVGGrid />

One last general point I want to mention before moving on: have you ever delved into the guts of an SVG file? If so, you may be aware that a small set of [basic shapes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes) exist—circles, rectangles, and polygons, among others, can all be easily drawn using native SVG elements. If your composition can be executed using only geometric shapes, these elements can make your life much simpler. We need to talk about another technique first, but put a pin in these. They’ll come in handy later on.

## Drawing Dynamic Paths

Unfortunately, we can’t rely on built-in SVG elements for everything. When we need to draw something more complex, like the wedges of a pie chart, we have to forgo their convenience in favor of a more flexible primitive: the SVG `path` element.

The thing that makes paths special and infinitely malleable is their `d` parameter, which allows you to define shapes using a relatively small set of commands. These so-called **line commands** provide us with the tools to effectively draw any two dimensional shape imaginable, one point at a time.

<LineCommandAnimation />

Line commands encode two essential bits of information: where we are going next, and how we should get there. Although they may look terse and intimidating at first, like some illegible robot hieroglyphics, you may be surprised how quickly you’re able to pick them up once you spend time with them. For this project, we need to talk specifically about 4 of these commands:

1. **Move To**, represented by the letter `M`, which allows you to update the origin point of a shape without drawing a visible line. Unless your path is drawn starting at the origin point of the SVG, it will begin with a MoveTo command.
2. **Line To**, represented by the letter `L`, which allows you to connect one point to another with a straight line.
3. **Arc To**, represented by the letter `A`, which allows you to connect one point to another with a portion of a circle or ellipse.
4. **Close Path**, represented by the letter `Z`, which can be added at the end of a path to connect the last point back to the first point in the path.

Because Arc To is by far the most complex command of this bunch, let's look more closely at the other three and then circle back to it (nyuk, nyuk, nyuk).

**Move To** and **Line To** commands are identical in their structure: they begin with their respective letter (`M` or `L`) followed by two numbers (the x- and y-coordinates of the next point in the path). The only difference between the two is that Line To commands connect the previously defined point to the next point with a visible line. So for example, the following code would draw a straight, 45° line starting at (2, 4) and then moving down 6 steps down and to the right 6 steps to (8, 10):

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 16 16">
	<path d="M 2 4 L 8 10" stroke="2" fill="none"></path>
</svg>
```

The **Close Path** command is even simpler—it’s literally just the letter `Z`. By calling this command, you're effectively telling the path "connect the previous point back to the first point in my path with a straight line." In the code above, if we added an additional Line To command followed by a Close Path command, we would draw a triangle.

Check out the demo below. Click anywhere on the SVG to add a new point, or move existing points around, and watch the path update in real time.

<PathDrawing />

## Two Points, Four Lines

In contrast to the simpler line commands, the **Arc To** command consists of the letter `A` followed by 7 numbers. This feels intuitively like an excessive amount of variables to keep in mind, if I’m being honest. So, before we ask what each of these numbers do, let’s first look at why we need so many data points just to draw a line.

If I want to connect two points via a straight line—like with a line to command—I only have one option for what that line could be. If I want to connect two points with an arc, however, the answer for how that should look is less straightforward.

When we invoke the arc to command, we’re essentially saying that we want to connect two points together using a segment of one of the ellipses that intersect those points. Because there are two possible ellipses that that could be drawn (clockwise or counterclockwise), and each ellipse has two possible segments (shorter or longer), we have four possible routes we could take to connect one point to another.

<ArcToAnimation />

With that context in mind, here are what each of those numbers represent:

1. The first two numbers describe the x- and y-radii of the underlying ellipse. These can be different if you need to draw something other than a perfect circle. For our purposes, though, we only ever need to draw circles, so we can simplify things and always set them to the same value.
2. The third number describes the rotation of the underlying ellipse. This only has an effect if your x- and y-radii are different, so we can safely set this to 0 and move on.
3. The fourth number, the `large-arc` flag, can be set to either `0` or `1`. It determines whether the rendered line should take the longer or shorter route around the ellipse to get to the next point. `0` draws the shorter arc while `1` draws the longer.
4. The fifth number, the `sweep` flag, is also a binary and defines the directionality of the line. Importantly, that directionality (clockwise or counterclockwise) is **relative to the position of the two points**. So, if your next point is directly below your previous point, `0` draws the arc in a counterclockwise direction while `1` draws it clockwise. That direction will rotate, however, as you move one point relative to the other.
5. And finally, the last two numbers simply define the x- and y- coordinates of the next point in the path—just like the previous commands we've discussed.

I’ve provided another sandbox below to help you get your arms around these (admittedly obtuse) concepts. But first, I’d like to share a few observations that I made while building this demo:

- If you toggle the `large arc` and `sweep direction` flags back and forth in tandem, you'll see two sections that, together, form a complete circle (or ellipse).
- The minimum diameter for an arc is equal to the distance between the two points (derived by the [Pythagorean Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem)). In other words, setting the diameter to a value less than that distance is effectively the same as setting it to that distance. That's why the radius input in the demo updates dynamically based on the position of the points.
- If the next point specified in the Arc To command is in the same position as the previous point, no arc will be drawn. This makes sense, of course—you also can’t draw a straight line between these two points—but we’ll need to account for this quirk when drawing the wedges of our chart.

<ArcDrawing />

In the next section, we’ll look at how to combine these line commands to draw the wedges of our pie chart. Before we move on, though, I want to leave you with one more example: how to draw a perfect circle using Arc To commands. Take note of how we need two points—one at the top of the SVG and one at the bottom—and two arcs, because you cannot connect a point to itself; and how—because each arc is exactly 50% of a circle—the exact way that we set the large arc and sweep flags doesn’t matter as long as both flags are set consistently on both arcs.

```jsx
const size = 100;
const radius = size / 2;

return (
  <svg viewBox={`0 0 ${size} ${size}`}>
    <path d={`M ${radius} 0
              A ${radius} ${radius} 0 0 1 ${radius} ${size}
              A ${radius} ${radius} 0 0 1 ${radius} 0`}>
  </svg>
)
```

If you take one idea away from the previous two sections, let it be this: dyamically constructing paths with code means knowing the points required to create a shape and understanding how to wield the various line commands to connect one point to the next. It is, for sure, more abstract than crafting SVGs with Figma or Illustrator, but it’s not conceptually all that different. Now, let’s talk about about one more concept we need to understand to be able to generate the wedges of our pie chart.

## Sine and Cosine

Close your eyes and visualize a sound wave. You might, in your mind’s eye, see a smooth, geometric waveform oscillating endlessly in a regular up-and-down pattern. That, my friend, is a sine wave.

Now imagine a straight line shooting through the vertical center of that wave. Trace the wave as it oscillates up and down around that center line. Consider how you could stop at any point along the wave and calculate it’s distance from that center line—positive if it’s above, negative if it’s below, zero if it intersects with the line. These are the qualities that make sine waves valuable in coding:

- they are **periodic**: they loop seamlessly and infinitely, starting and ending at the exact same point
- they are **harmonic**: they have a smooth, fluid rhythm due to the way that they ease into and out of their maximum and minimum points
- they are **symmetrical**: the distance from any point along the wave to the center line will be between a number and it’s inverse (n and -n)

Now, what if I told you that sine waves have these characteristics because they are derived from circles—that we can use the sine function to translate a percentage into a specific point along the perimeter of a circle?

<SineAnimation />

I want to avoid jargon in this conversation as much as possible. However, we do need to define a few key terms to help us make the jump from sine waves to pie charts:

- The **radius** of a circle is the distance from it’s center to it’s outer edge
- The **circumference** is the length of the perimeter of a circle, and is equal to it’s radius multiplied by two times pi (2πr). (Crucially, you don’t need to know anyting about pi beyond the fact that you need two of them to draw a full circle.)
- A **unit circle** is a circle with a radius of 1, meaning it’s circumference is simply equal to 2π.
- **Radians** are a unit of measurement that describe the angle formed by an arc relative to the radius of a circle. If you find that definition confusing—don’t worry. All you really need to know is that for a unit circle, the angle of an arc in radians will be some fraction of it’s circumfrence (2π).

At its most basic, a sine function calculates the distance from any point along a sine wave to the center line. Because sine functions generally operate on a unit circle, the distance calculated will always be between -1 and 1. To find this distance, the sine function needs to know the angle, in radians, of the point we want to calculate, which we can find by multiplying the circumference of the unit circle by some percentage. In practice, you might express that like this:

```js
// for a number (progress) between 0 and 100
const progress = 35;
const radians = (progress / 100) * (Math.PI * 2);
const distance = Math.sin(radians); // 0.8090169
```

Fortunately, the **cosine** function is conceptually the same as the sine function. The only salient difference, at least from a non-technical perspective, is that the value returned by cosine is **phase shifted**—a fancy way of saying that cosine functions begin their calculations at a different point along the wave. Or to put it in more practical terms—the sine of 0 is 0, whereas the cosine of 0 is 1. It's the same wave, it just starts earlier.

So why does all of this matter? Simply put, sine (and cosine) functions allow us to translate progress—whether it be the indefinite march of time or the percent complete of a goal—into a number between -1 and 1. Once we have that number, our options are limited only by our imaginations. A common move it to use that value to animate the position of an element. In the demo below, move the progress slider and watch how we can use these functions to manipulate the x-coordinate of a circle:

<SineCos />

At this point, you may see where this is going. Because sine and cosine are derived from circles, and because cosine is essentially just the sine function rotated 90 degrees, we can use them together to find any point around the circumference of a circle. I like to think of it as the percent-to-point pipeline.

All we need to know is the radius of a circle and the coordinates of its center. From there, finding a specific point is as simple as:

- assigning `centerCoord + sin(progress * 2π) * radians` to one coordinate
- assigning `centerCoord - cos(progress * 2π) * radians` to the other

<SineCircle />

Tying together everything we've discussed so far, here’s the full code used to calculate the pie chart wedge in the above demo. It’s worth noting that questions about which function (sine or cosine) shoulde be applied to which axis (x or y), and whether to add to or subtract from the center coordinates, do not have definite answers. Those decisions are left to your discretion as a designer, based on the point at which you want to begin drawing your circle.

```js
// declare fixed attributes
const center = { x: 50, y: 50 };
const radius = 30;

// calculate dynamic attributes
const radians = (progress / 100) * Math.PI * 2;
const x = center.x + Math.sin(radians) * radius;
const y = center.y - Math.cos(radians) * radius;
const largeArc = radians > Math.PI ? 1 : 0;

// synthesize dynamic path
const pie = `M ${center} ${center - radius}
             A ${radius} ${radius} 0 ${largeArc} 1 ${x} ${y}
             L ${center} ${center} Z`;
```

## Masking and Donut Holes

At this point, you could, in theory, use the techniques we’ve already discussed to draw your donut chart—hole and all. But as much as I love a good a math problem, that would be unnecessarily complex. Instead, we’re going to use a technique called **masking** to greatly simplify the process of defining our chart’s silhouette.

I like to think of masks as custom viewports that allow us to describe which parts of a shape (or group of shapes) should and should not be displayed. Do you remember how shapes that are placed outside of the bounds of an SVG’s `viewBox` are not rendered? Masks serve a similar function—defining the contours of what is rendered—but they can use any 2D shape, not just basic rectangles.

Now, there is technically one other tool in the SVG toolbox that we could use to achieve this effect. Like masks, **clipping paths** also allow us to show and hide parts of our drawing. However, masks have a special feature that make them uniquely well-suited to our needs in this instance.

With both masks and clipping paths, we can combine multiple, simple shapes together to create more complex and interesting silhouettes. But with masks, specifically, we can use color to describe how those shapes should interact—a feature known as **alpha transparency**. Inside of a `mask`, black shapes are added to, and white shapes are subtracted from, the composite mask. If you've ever used Figma’s [Boolean Operations](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039957534-Boolean-operations) or Illustrator's [Pathfinder](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/combining-objects.html#pathfinder_panel_overview), this concept of merging shapes should feel relatively familiar.

The upshot of this is that we can achieve a donut-shaped chart by using a mask with a smaller black circle on top of a larger white circle. And as we discussed earlier, these shapes are readily available via the SVG `circle` element.

```html
<defs>
	<mask id="donut">
		<circle cx="10" cy="10" r="18" fill="white" />
		<circle cx="10" cy="10" r="6" fill="black" />
	</mask>
</defs>
```

I’ve got one more demo for you to help ground some of these ideas, but first I want to address a few other nuances of SVG masking that you may notice:

- Masks must be wrapped in a `defs` element, which allows us to store anything that we need to reference in our SVG, but that we do not want to render directly. This is also where we would define other "invisible" elements like clipping paths and [gradients](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Gradients).
- Elements inside of a mask can be any color, not just black or white. When you set a mask element to another color, like medium gray, that element will be added to the mask with a transparency equal to the color's lightness—which is where the name "alpha transparency" comes from.
- Stacking order does matter, just like in Figma's boolean operations. If you want to knock one shape out of another, for example, that shape must be positioned on top of the other. Below, move the shapes around to see this effect in action.

<SVGMask />

## Putting It All Together

If you made it this far—I’m sorry, or you’re welcome. The least I can do for your diligence is give you some copypastable code to take with you. Below is a composable React component that pulls together everything we’ve talked about thus far—the exact same one you played with at the beginning of this article, in fact.

```jsx
interface ProgressIndicatorProps {
	percent: number;
	outDia?: number;
	inDia?: number;
	donut?: boolean;
}

function ProgressIndicator(props: ProgressIndicatorProps) {
	const { percent, outDia = 30, inDia = 24, donut = true } = props;
	const maskURL = useId();
	const size = outDia + 2;
	const center = size / 2;

	const radians = (percent / 100) * 2 * Math.PI;
	const x = center + center * Math.sin(radians);
	const y = center - center * Math.cos(radians);
	const largeArc = radians > Math.PI ? 1 : 0;

	const circPath = `M ${center} 0
                   A ${center} ${center} 0 ${largeArc} 1 ${center} ${outDia}
                   A ${center} ${center} 0 ${largeArc} 1 ${center} 0`;

	const wedgePath =
		percent === 100
			? circPath
			: `M ${center} 0
        A ${center} ${center} 0 ${largeArc} 1 ${x} ${y}
        L ${center} ${center} Z`;

	return (
		<svg
			width={size}
			height={size}
			viewBox={`0 0 ${size} ${size}`}
			data-filled={percent === 100 ? "" : undefined}
		>
			<g mask={`url(#${maskURL})`}>
				<circle className={s.background} cx={center} cy={center} r={outDia / 2} />
				<path className={s.foreground} d={wedgePath} />
			</g>
			<defs>
				<mask id={maskURL}>
					<circle cx={center} cy={center} r={outDia / 2} fill="white" />
					{donut && <circle cx={center} cy={center} r={inDia / 2} fill="black" />}
				</mask>
			</defs>
		</svg>
	);
}
```
