# Dynamic SVG Pie Charts

Not all SVGs are created equal.

Or, to be more precise, not all SVG renderers are created equal. [SVG](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/), like many of the technologies we use in our work, is a specification—a standardized set of principles, which were written out and agreed upon, and then interpretted and executed by a variety of parties over time. This process is ultimately a good faith agreement, meaning that any individual implementation may or may not be feature-complete and standard-compliant.

In a time with [such a large emphasis on parity](https://web.dev/blog/interop-2024), it’s a truth that can be easy to forget. That is, until it isn’t.

## The Problem

I built my first [Figma widget](https://www.figma.com/widget-docs/) recently. Simply put, widgets are Figma components with super powers. They live on your design or FigJam canvas like any other component, but are hydrated with Javascript and are therefore interactive. For our purposes, we built a simple checklist widget to help product designers prepare their files for production and increase transparency in design handoffs.

Given that widgets have to live amongst all your other, common components, Figma provides an understandably limited set of tools to buld them. In our widget, we wanted to include some sort of visual indicator of a user’s progress through the checklist. Given these limitations, the only path forward seemed to be SVG. My options were even more limited than I realized, however, which became apparent when I attempted to draw a donut chart using the `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties, as [outlined in a great article](https://heyoka.medium.com/scratch-made-svg-donut-pie-charts-in-html5-2c587e935d72) by Mark Caron.

To my surpise, Figma's implementation of SVG is non-standard. The `stroke-dasharray` property does not render the same in Figma as it does in browsers, and so the most simple solution turned out to be a nonstarter.

But necessity is the mother of invention. My final solution ended up being more flexible than rendering the charts with strokes alone, and also demonstrates a few key concepts of designing and building with SVG (and math!):

1. Programatically drawing paths based on a dynamic set of inputs
2. Using clipping masks to define and shape our graphic's silhouette
3. Using `sin` and `cos` to visualize our current progress

Here's a preview of what we'll be building, which I'll break down step-by-step below.

## On the Grid

An SVG is a world unto itself. Especially in terms of layout, it cares little about what's happening outside of its four corners. SVGs are arranged along a two dimensional grid with their origin in the top left corner (much like a [2D HTML canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D)). The bounds of that grid are defined by an SVG's `viewBox`—a string of 4 space-separated numbers corresponding to the `x` and `y` coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the SVG, respectively. For all practical purposes, the first two numbers are always 0, and the last two numbers are often (but not necessarily) the same as the SVG's width and height. Importantly, though, no matter how large or small the SVG is displayed on screen, the viewBox—and coordinates of the grid that it defines—never changes.

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 32 24"></svg>
```

The code above renders an SVG that spans from 0 to 32 units along the x-axis and from 0 to 24 units along the y-axis. Keep in mind, though, that although these units are established by the SVG’s `viewBox`, they scale linearly with its `width`. If you added a circle with a `stroke-width` of 2 to the above SVG but then rendered it at 96px wide (3x the `viewBox`), that stroke would look roughly equivalent to a 6px line outside of the SVG.

And speaking of circles—have you ever delved into the guts of an SVG file? If so, you may be aware that a small set of [basic shapes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes) exist: circles, rectangles, and polygons, for example, can all be easily constructed using native SVG elements. If your drawing uses only geometric shapes, these elements can make your job much simpler.

Before we move on to drawing more complex shapes, take a moment to play around with the sandbox below. Move the circle around, resize the SVG, and generally get a feel for how the allocation of space works inside of an SVG.

## Drawing Dynamic Paths

We've talked about how to render simple geometric shapes. But what about when we need to draw something more complex, like the wedges of our pie chart? For that, we’ll need to forgo the convenience of these built-in elements in favor of a more flexible primitive: the SVG `path` element.

The thing that makes paths special and infinitely malleable is its `d` parameter, which allows you to define shapes using a small set of commands. These so-called **line commands** provide us with the tools to draw effectively any two dimensinal shape imaginable, one point at a time. Line commands encode two essential bits of information: where are we going next, and how should we get there.

These commands may look obtuse and intimidating at first, like some illegible robot hieroglyphics. Spend some time with them, though. You may be surprised how quickly you pick them up. For this project, we need to talk specifically about 4 of these commands:

1. **Move To**, represented by the letter `M`, which allows you to update the origin point of a shape without drawing a visible line. Unless your path is drawn starting at the origin point, it will begin with a MoveTo command.
2. **Line To**, represented by the letter `L`, which allows you to connect one point to another with a straight line.
3. **Arc To**, represented by the letter `A`, which allows you to connect one point to another with a portion of a circle or ellipse.
4. **Close Path**, represented by the letter `Z`, which can be added at the end of a path to connect the last point back to the first point in the path.

Because Arc To is by far the most complex command of this bunch, let's look more closely at the other three and then circle back on it (nyuk, nyuk, nyuk).

**Move To** and **Line To** commands are identical in their structure: they begin with their respective letter (`M` or `L`) followed by two numbers (the x- and y-coordinates of the next point in the path). The only difference between the two is that Line To commands connect the previously defined point to the next point with a visible line. So for example, the following code would draw a straight, 45° line starting at (2, 4) and then moving down 6 units down and to the right 6 units to (8, 10):

```
<path d="M 2 4 L 8 10" stroke="2" fill="none">
```

The **Close Path** command is even simpler—it’s literally just the letter `Z`. By calling this command, you're effectively telling the path "connect the previous point to my shape’s origin point with a straight line." In the previous example, if we added an additional Line To command followed by a Close Path command, we would draw a triangle.

Before we move on, check out the demo below. Click anywhere on the SVG to add a new point, or try moving existing points around, and watch the path update in real time.

## Circling back

Now that we’ve got a feel for the first three line command, it's time to turn it up a notch.

In this section, I need to explain the following concepts:

- Paths v shapes (keep this short)
- The M, L, A, and Z commands
  - I should briefly mention the difference between capital and lowercase commands (maybe as a callout)
  - To demonstrate the M, L, and Z commands, what if I had a component where you could click anywhere to add a point and see the path code update in sync?
  - Then, with a second component, I should explore the different aspects of the arc command

## Footnotes

1. Before you get too excited—widgets are only interactive on your canvas and are not interactive in the context of a prototype. If you mind, like mine, immediately began racing with all of the cool interactions you could build with this API—sorry.

Detritus

Like I mentioned before, Move To commands are often the first command provided to a path because the invisibly update the currently active point
