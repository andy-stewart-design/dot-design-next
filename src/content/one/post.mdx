# Dynamic SVG Pie Charts

Not all SVGs are created equal.

Or, to be more precise, not all SVG renderers are created equal. [SVG](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/), like many of the technologies we use in our work, is a specification—a standardized set of principles, which were written out and agreed upon, and then interpretted and implemented by a variety of parties over time. This process is ultimately a good faith agreement, meaning that any individual rendering engine may or may not be feature-complete and standard-compliant.

In a time with [such a large emphasis on parity](https://web.dev/blog/interop-2024), it’s a truth that can be easy to forget. That is, until it isn’t.

## The Problem

I built my first [Figma widget](https://www.figma.com/widget-docs/) recently. Simply put, widgets are Figma components with super powers. They live on your design or FigJam canvas like any other component, but are hydrated with Javascript and are therefore interactive. For our purposes, we built a simple checklist widget to help product designers prepare their files for production and increase transparency in design handoffs.

Given that widgets have to live amongst all your other, common components, Figma provides an understandably limited set of tools to buld them. In our widget, we wanted to include some sort of visual indicator of a user’s progress through the checklist. Given these limitations, the only path forward seemed to be SVG. My options were even more limited than I realized, however, which became apparent when I attempted to draw a donut chart using the `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties, as [outlined in a great article](https://heyoka.medium.com/scratch-made-svg-donut-pie-charts-in-html5-2c587e935d72) by Mark Caron.

To my surpise, Figma's implementation of SVG is non-standard. The `stroke-dasharray` property does not render the same in Figma as it does in browsers, and so the most simple solution turned out to be a nonstarter.

But necessity is the mother of invention. My final solution ended up being more flexible than rendering the charts with strokes alone, and also demonstrates a few key concepts of designing and building with SVG (and math!):

1. Programatically drawing paths based on a dynamic set of inputs
2. Using clipping masks to define and shape our graphic's silhouette
3. Using `sin` and `cos` to visualize our current progress

Here's a preview of what we'll be building, which I'll break down step-by-step below.

## On the Grid

An SVG is a world unto itself, especially when it comes to layout. SVGs are arranged along a two dimensional grid with their origin in the top left corner (like a 2D HTML canvas). The bounds of that grid are defined by an SVG's `viewBox`—a string of 4 space-separated numbers corresponding to the x/y coordinates of the top left and bottom right corners of the SVG, respectively. For all practical purposes, the first two numbers are always 0, and the last two numbers are often (but not necessarily) the same as the SVG's width and height. Importantly, though, no matter how large of small the SVG is displayed on screen, the viewBox—and the grid that it defines—never changes.

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 32 24"></svg>
```

The code above renders an SVG that spans from 0 to 32 units along the x-axis and from 0 to 24 units along the y-axis. Keep in mind, though, that these units are by default relative to—and scale proportionatly with—the SVG’s `viewBox`. If you added a circle with a `stroke-width` of 2 to the above SVG but then rendered it at 96px wide (3x the `viewBox`), that stroke would look roughly equivalent to a 6px line outside of the SVG.

And speaking of circles—have ever delved into the guts of an SVG file? If so, you may be aware that a small set of [basic shapes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes) exist: circles, rectangles, and polygons, for example, can all be easily constructed using native SVG elements. If your drawing uses only simple, geometric shapes, these elements can make your job much simpler.

Before we move on to drawing more complex shapes, play around with the below sandbox to get a feel for how space works inside of an SVG.

## Drawing Dynamic Paths

But in order to accomplish something more complex, like drawing the wedges of our chart, we’ll need to forgo the convenience of these elements in favor of a more flexible primitive: the SVG `path` element.

The thing that makes paths special is the `d` parameter, which allows you to define shapes using a small set of commands. For this project, we need to talk specifically about 4 of those commands:

1. the MoveTo command, represented by the letter `M`. This commands allows you to update the origin point of a shape without drawing a visible line. Unless your path is drawn starting at the origin point, it will begin with a MoveTo command.

Check out the demo below. Click anywhere to add a new point, or try moving existing points around, and watch the path update in real time.

In this section, I need to explain the following concepts:

- Paths v shapes (keep this short)
- The M, L, A, and Z commands
  - I should briefly mention the difference between capital and lowercase commands (maybe as a callout)
  - To demonstrate the M, L, and Z commands, what if I had a component where you could click anywhere to add a point and see the path code update in sync?
  - Then, with a second component, I should explore the different aspects of the arc command

## Footnotes

1. Before you get too excited—widgets are only interactive on your canvas and are not interactive in the context of a prototype. If you mind, like mine, immediately began racing with all of the cool interactions you could build with this API—sorry.
