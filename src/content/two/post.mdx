# AllStock 2.0 for Figma

A little Figma plugin I released last year recently passed 4K users. Not too shabby for a project that I published and then promptly never talked about publicly.

The plugin is called [AllStock](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1235675201027690011/allstock), and it’s a one-stop shop for finding and using high-quality stock images directly inside of Figma. It gives users access to the most popular free photo libraries around—like Unsplash, Pexels, and Pixabay—in a unified, approachable interface, all without needing to leave the comfort of their design file.

The project initially started as a learning exercise to explore Figma’s plugin API. Unexpectedly, a nontrivial number of people found it useful, so over the 2023 holiday break I decided to dive back in and rebuild it into a more proper product.

In the end, I overhauled every part of the codebase from the ground up, from the frontend user interface to the backend proxy endpoints. Here are some of my favorite details from the project:

## Easier Access

You can now launch the plugin directly from Figma’s quick actions menu (Figma’s native launcher—think Spotlight or Raycast). In your Figma design file, simply type `command + /` on Mac to access the quick actions menu, and then enter "allstock" and your search query to get started.

I’m also now keeping the plugin open by default after you import an image, based on user feedback, in case you want to import multiple images in a single session (you’re welcome, Kyle).

## More Secure

Figma plugins are strictly frontend, client side applications, meaning there’s no straightforward way to protect secret keys. In the original build, I did my best to obfuscate all requisite API keys, but it was admittedly a bit hacky.

This time around, I’m proxying all requests through hand-rolled Vercel edge functions (using the web framework [Hono JS](https://hono.dev/)), meaning the API keys never have to touch the client side code. (And don’t worry—I got new keys, too.)

## More Performant

In the first version of the plugin, I imported images directly from the relevant image service into the file. It made the development process extremely efficient, but not without a long-term cost. The size of these raw images ended up becoming a liability, slowing down—and occasionally even crashing—the plugin.

Now, I’m using ImageKit under the hood to optimize images before importing them into the file. As a side effect, this also affords users more control over the output size and quality of photos.

## Streamlined Interface

If I’m honest, a lot of the "backend" work described above is in service of my desire to design frontend interfaces. The new interface simplifies the search process by getting lesser-used options out of the way and putting the search input and service select boxes front and center. Additional filters can be accessed in an offscreen dialog as needed.

Other quality of life features, such as previewing larger versions of images before importing them, and browsing results in a custom masonry-style layout, help make the experience feel more polished and complete.

I love side projects like this, where a seemingly small and straightforward idea ends up leading you in several unexpected directions. Looking back, I already had about 75-80% of the knowledge that I would need to accomplish my goal—meaning I had enough new concepts to explore to keep things interesting, but not so many that I got lost or overwhelmed.

If you want to try it out for yourself, the plugin is available now [wherever you get your plugins](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1235675201027690011) (i.e. the Figma community).
